## What is an ember-cli-deploy plugin?

A plugin is an addon that can be executed as a part of the ember-cli-deploy pipeline. A plugin will implement one or more of the ember-cli-deploy's pipeline hooks.

For more information on what plugins are and how they work, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][1].

## Quick Start

To get up and running quickly, do the following:

- Ensure [ember-cli-deploy-build-plus][2] is installed and configured.

- Install this plugin

```bash
$ ember install ember-cli-deploy-sftp
```

- Place the following configuration into `config/deploy.js`

```javascript
module.exports = function(deployTarget) {
  var ENV = { };

  if (deployTarget === 'production') {
    ENV.sftp = {
      host: 'server.com',
      remoteDir: '/home/server/http-docs/sftptest',
      remoteUser: process.env.remoteUser,
      privateKey: process.env.privateKey
    };
